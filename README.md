### Hi there 👋

<!--
**SolicitedPoet2/SolicitedPoet2** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#(It has been 2 years since I learn C#) and Unity to make a rhythm game which I want to make!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with my logic on programs, it would be awesome if someone was help me in that!
- 💬 Ask me about Electronic Stuff(I like it a lot but I don't have so much knowledge about it yet!).
- 📫 How to reach me: On Discord, usually I chat on there, but there's sometimes I'm not there because probably I'm studying, my contact: Sofia(Aka Soli)#7636. 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: my nick name is SolicitedPoet2(the nickname Solicited Poet was made when I was 9 years old and the Xbox 360 name generator system generated that name and I liked it a lot, even if I don't know what it meant.) but I'm not a poet, lol. But when I have time, I'll practice to do some poem.
